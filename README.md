# Fusuma Config

This is my current configuration directory for [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma).

## Setting up

Clone the repository and set up a symbolic link in your home config directory.

I use Ubuntu, but should apply in most cases?

    git clone https://github.com/scaryrawr/fusumaconf
    ln -s ./fusuma ~/.config/fusuma

Follow the installation instructions for [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma#installation).
